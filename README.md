# Data Science Project - Shufersal Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on scraping (via crawling) a dataset from Shufersal, one of the largest supermarket chains in Israel. The scraped data is then used to perform a complete data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and the application of various machine learning techniques to build predictive models.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - The dataset is scraped from Shufersal's website using web crawling techniques.
   - The raw data collected includes a variety of product features, many of which contain incomplete or inconsistent values.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - The dataset is cleaned by addressing missing values and removing irrelevant or redundant features.
   - Features with insufficient data are dropped to ensure meaningful analysis.
   - Further preprocessing includes standardizing or encoding the data where necessary, preparing it for machine learning models.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - A detailed analysis is performed to understand the dataset, identify trends, and highlight key insights.
   - Visualizations and summary statistics are used to describe the dataset and inform the model-building process.

### 4. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Multiple machine learning models are built using various algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, etc.).
   - Each model is trained, cross-validated, and evaluated for performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

### 5. **Results and Insights**
   - The results of the models are compared to identify the best-performing algorithm.
   - Insights gained from the data and models are summarized, providing actionable information.
